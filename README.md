# LanguagePackConverter
Converting Traditional Chinese Language Packs to Simplified


- Currently supports converting XML files with traditional chinese inner text to simplified
- Requires:
  - Python3
  - hanzicov

- Using the converter:
  - **NOTE**: This script will only work on games with language packs stored as the XML file type.
  - Navigate to game file location in steam folder. For a windows machine this would likely be something similar to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NameOfGame"
  - If you have python3 and hanzicov installed, run fanToJian.py in your game directory and it should automatically convert all XML files with traditional Chinese to simplified.
  - If you do not have python3, you can run the fanToJian.exe (link below) file in your game directory and it should automatically convert all XML files with traditional Chinese to simplified.
  
-Use this program at your own risk. I reccomend that you backup your game files before running this script, as it may alter files in an unwanted manner (if non XML files are in someway dependent on the internal XML text, changing from traditional to simplified characters could result in issues with your game).
